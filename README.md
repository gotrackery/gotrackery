GoTrackery provides a server for obtaining geo-location from GPS trackers of their various protocols. The extracted geo-location data is converted into a single format and allows subscribers to process them in a single way.

Currently implemented:
- Wialon IPS
- EGTS

Future plans for the implementation of other protocols see https://github.com/gotrackery/protocol
